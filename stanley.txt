Stanley looked patiently at his empty screen, awaiting further instruction.

The Stanley Parable is a game that elicits the discussion "what IS a game, really?" among the kind of people who tend to miss the point.
That isn't to deem discourse on the subject an unworthy endeavor, but Stanley really isn't the type of person to get involved with that sort of thing.
Then again, Stanley wasn't there. He, well... he didn't show up (quite unlike Stanley).
Now there's no need to worry. Stanley is perfectly fine- content in the life composed of the decisions he has made, compliant ONLY to his own will.
Surely content! Surely his own will!

When no further instruction came, Stanley began to feel anxious. People had expectations.

"Player Choice!" the crowd chimes, united at the prompt to recite where why and how "games" excel.
Choice is how individuals express agency! How can option "C" be particularly meaningful if not for the presence of option "B"?!
And choice they were granted. At least, it did seem that way.

Stanley would wait. In the mean time, he could take a sip of his water. Or maybe twiddle his thumbs.

But what of option "D"? Or "E"? Or "H", "K", "Q", and everything between?
Does the mere existence of each alternative in turn somehow amplify the meaning of our chosen "C"?
Ah, but alas, a game can only do so much. What if we just *pretended* there was an "E"?
Maybe it's just the *belief* of an alternate- the *illusion* of choice that begets meaning...
A player need only *think* she could have done otherwise- that the judgement she commands bears consequence...
...maybe?

No! Stanley would not sit idle. He would take control of the situation. He would let his will be known!

And there he stood. Confronted with the very real consequences of his very real choice.
But that didn't really matter. Not with respect to "what could have been", anyways.
More than any significance derived from choosing one thing as opposed to another was delight from the affirmation of the thing we chose!
Reassurance of progression towards a fundamentally non-existant goal. Cooperative exploration of the deterministic space set in front of us. Play.

The Stanley Parable IS a game, and it DOES have choice.
